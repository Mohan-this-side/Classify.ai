# Docker Build Fix - I/O Error Solution

## Problem
Docker build failing with "Input/output error" when trying to change ownership of files in the virtual environment directory.

## Root Cause
The `COPY . .` command in `Dockerfile.backend` is copying the local `venv/` directory, which contains read-only files that cause I/O errors during ownership changes.

## Solution Implemented

Created `backend/.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files:
- venv/ directory
- __pycache__ files
- Test files
- Logs
- IDE files

## Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Restart Docker Desktop (Recommended)
```bash
# Restart Docker Desktop application
# Then rebuild
cd /Users/mohan/NEU/FALL\ 2025/AGENTS\ V1/ds-capstone-project
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache backend
```

### Option 2: Clean Docker System
```bash
# Clean Docker build cache
docker builder prune -af

# Remove old images
docker image prune -af

# Rebuild
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache backend
```

### Option 3: Rebuild Specific Services
```bash
# Build only backend (without other services)
cd docker
docker-compose build backend

# Or build all services
docker-compose build
```

### Option 4: Check Disk Space
```bash
# Check available disk space
df -h

# Check Docker disk usage
docker system df

# If Docker is using too much space, clean it
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

## Verification

After rebuilding, verify the fix:
```bash
# Check if backend image was created
docker images | grep ds-capstone

# Try starting services
cd docker
docker-compose up -d backend postgres redis

# Check logs
docker-compose logs backend
```

## Alternative: Test Without Docker

If Docker issues persist, you can test the system locally:

```bash
# Start backend locally
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, run tests
python3 test_full_workflow_with_docker.py
```

The Docker sandbox for Layer 2 execution can be started separately later when Docker issues are resolved.

## Summary

- ✅ Created `.dockerignore` to exclude venv/
- ✅ Fixed Gemini integration
- ✅ All test scripts ready
- ⚠️ Docker build needs to be retried after Docker Desktop restart
