# Docker Sandbox Workflow Requirement

## Your Requirement

You want to verify that:
1. Each agent performs Layer 1 hardcoded analysis
2. Uses that analysis to create an LLM prompt
3. LLM generates Python code
4. **Generated code runs in Docker sandbox** ← THIS IS CRITICAL
5. Sandbox output is used as Layer 2 results
6. Results passed to next agent

## Current Issue

The Docker I/O error prevents building the ML sandbox container. Without the sandbox:
- Layer 2 generates code ✅
- Code validation works ✅
- But code never executes in Docker sandbox ❌
- Results cannot be retrieved ❌
- Cannot pass results to next agent ❌

## What Needs to Happen

### Required Services

The ML sandbox Docker container must be running with:
- **Image**: Based on `Dockerfile.sandbox` with ML libraries
- **Resources**: 2GB RAM, 1.5 CPU limit
- **Isolation**: No network access (secure)
- **Volumes**: For code and results

### Workflow Flow

```
Agent → Layer 1 analysis → LLM generates code → Docker sandbox executes code → Results returned → Next agent
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Docker I/O Error (Recommended)

1. **Restart Docker Desktop completely**
   - Quit Docker Desktop application
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Restart Docker Desktop
   - Verify: `docker ps`

2. **Clean Docker system**
   ```bash
   docker system prune -af --volumes
   ```

3. **Rebuild sandbox**
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose build ml-sandbox
   docker-compose up -d ml-sandbox
   ```

### Option 2: Test Without Full Sandbox (Current Workaround)

Currently testing shows:
- ✅ Layer 1 works perfectly (provides results)
- ✅ LLM code generation works
- ❌ Sandbox execution cannot be tested (Docker I/O error)
- ⚠️ Results cannot be retrieved without sandbox

**Workaround**: Layer 1 provides excellent results that can be used

### Option 3: Use Pre-built Sandbox Image

If you have Docker Hub access:
1. Push/use pre-built image
2. Skip the build step

## What I've Done

1. ✅ Fixed Gemini integration
2. ✅ Fixed JSON serialization
3. ✅ Created `.dockerignore` to exclude venv
4. ✅ Created comprehensive test scripts
5. ✅ Verified Layer 1 works
6. ✅ Verified LLM code generation works
7. ❌ Cannot complete sandbox execution test due to Docker I/O error

## What You Need to Do

**To test the complete workflow with Docker sandbox:**

1. Restart Docker Desktop
2. Clean Docker: `docker system prune -af`
3. Build sandbox: `cd docker && docker-compose build ml-sandbox`
4. Start sandbox: `docker-compose up -d ml-sandbox`
5. Run full test: `python3 test_full_docker_workflow.py`

## Current Test Results

**Without Docker sandbox running:**
- ✅ Layer 1 analysis: Working
- ✅ LLM code generation: Working
- ❌ Docker sandbox execution: **Cannot test** (Docker I/O error)
- ⚠️ Results retrieval: **Cannot test** (needs sandbox output)
- ⚠️ Results to next agent: **Cannot test** (needs sandbox results)

**Summary**: Infrastructure is ready, but Docker I/O error prevents sandbox testing.

## Next Steps

Please restart Docker Desktop and I'll help you test the complete workflow with Docker sandbox execution!
